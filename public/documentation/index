<h1 id="common-transit-convention-api-end-to-end-service-guide">Common Transit Convention API end-to-end service guide</h1>
<p>Version 0.1 issued 6th April 2020</p>

<hr>
<p>This guide explains how you can use our Common Transit Convention (CTC) API with your software. It allows you to send and receive movement notifications and status messages to and from the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS). This API replaces the NCTS XML API Channel that is currently in use.</p>
<h2 id="changes-to-the-ctc-api">Changes to the CTC API</h2>
<p>This guide describes essential changes to the existing CTC XML API to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>respond to changes to the NCTS system</p></li>
<li><p>improve security</p></li>
<li><p>accommodate the expected increase in CTC movements</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The guide shows how the API fits into various end-to-end user journeys. It aims to help you understand how your software needs to interact with HMRC systems after the changes.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>UK traders can move goods freely across EU countries at the moment. This will change now the UK has left the EU. From 1 January 2021, UK traders will start moving goods under the Common Transit Convention instead.</p>
<p>Common Transit Convention makes sure that traders pay the right country the right amount of tax. It means traders only pay tax for goods once they reach their final destination, rather than at each country border that the goods pass through.</p>
<p>When moving goods using the Common Transit Convention, a trader will need to let the Office of Departure know that the goods have arrived at their final destination. This is done by sending an arrival notification message to the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS).</p>
<p>This means that the number of goods movements being declared through the NCTS will increase. The NCTS has been upgraded already to prepare for these increases.</p>
<h2 id="sending-messages-to-the-ncts">Sending messages to the NCTS</h2>
<p>You can currently send messages to the NCTS by email, web and API. The way messages can be sent to the NCTS is expected to change from 1 January 2021.</p>
<h2 id="api">API</h2>
<p>The current API will not be able to cope with the increased number of messages being sent to the NCTS. Changes will be made to NCTS, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>removing the EDIFACT wrapper</p></li>
<li><p>increasing rate limits</p></li>
<li><p>moving to the cloud so it can flex with demand</p></li>
<li><p>improving authorisation functionality</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-the-api">Using the API</h2>
<p>Traders who send a high number of messages and notifications should use the API.  This is because the API can accept up to 999 messages at once, whereas the web form can only accept up to 99 messages. The API will allow traders to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>send arrival notifications to the Office of Destination</p></li>
<li><p>send departure notifications to the Office of Departure</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This diagram shows how an arrival notification message is sent by the user using third party software to the NCTS, using the CTC API.</p>

<li>Third party software redirects the user to the Government Gateway to get access to the CTC API.</li>
<li>Government Gateway account is authenticated and redirects the user back to 3rd party software.</li>
<li>The user sends an arrival notification message using third party software.</li>
<li>Arrival notification message passes through the CTC API.</li>
<li>Arrival notification message is received by the NCTS.</li>
<li>An accepted status is sent to the CTC API when the NCTS receives the arrival notification.</li>
<li>The accepted status passes through the CTC API.</li>
<li>The accepted status arrives at the third party software, where the user is notified the NCTS has received the arrival notification message.</li>
